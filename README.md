Lab 1: Input/Output Interfacing and Traffic Light Controller, FSMs

Abstract:
Student gained familiarity with IAR workbench software development environment useful in programming the EK-TM4C123 board.  While learning basics of general-purpose input and output (GPIO) he performing simple digital input (interfacing push button) and output (interfacing LED).  The student gained an understanding the power of pointers in C and how to use them in addressing GPIO registers.  Perusal of specifications sheets and datasheet to extract information was necessary for addressing the LaunchPad components.  Lastly, a design and implementation of a finite state machine (FSM) traffic light controller was completed.
